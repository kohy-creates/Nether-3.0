**Do you only want to slightly modify the Nether and not add a couple thousands of different mechanics?**
Or do you just want some neat improvements to the Nether generation?
Or are you looking for a worldgen datapack that **supports multiplayer**? (including Bukkit/Spigot/Paper servers, etc.)

### What does Nether 3.0 have to offer?

**Increased World Height?** You got this. The world height is now 192 blocks + 64 extra blocks for the roof!
It supports Multiplayer servers, no matter if it is Vanilla, or Bukkit/Spigot/Paper/Purpur/any other fork!
**All biomes rehauled?** That one was kinda obvious, but of course!

And yeah, that's all. Unlike my Ender Expansion pack - Stellarity - I want to keep the Nether rehaul simple.
